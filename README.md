## FAQ

**Should I book flights directly with airlines or through booking platforms?**
Booking directly with airlines typically provides better customer service for changes, cancellations, and irregular operations like delays, plus loyalty program benefits and often better seat selection. However, booking platforms frequently offer lower prices, especially on OTA "secret fares" and by comparing 500+ airlines simultaneously finding routes you'd never discover manually. Best practice: use platforms to find cheapest options, then check airline direct pricing—if prices match or differ by under $20, book direct for superior service.

**When is the best time to book flights for lowest prices?**
Book domestic flights approximately 28 days before departure and international flights 60 days before for optimal pricing, though this varies by route and season. Tuesday and Wednesday departures typically cost less than Friday through Monday travel. Set price alerts on platforms like Google Flights or Hopper 2-3 months before your trip to track fare trends rather than guessing optimal booking moment. Last-minute deals still exist though relying on them risks sold-out flights or premium pricing.

**Are flight deal alert services like Going and Dollar Flight Club worth the cost?**
Premium deal services save $200-800 on average per international booking through mistake fares and flash sales casual searchers miss, paying for annual subscriptions ($49-99) with single trip. However, they require flexibility on dates, destinations, and sometimes departure times since deals appear spontaneously rather than matching predetermined plans. Best for travelers who book 2+ international trips annually and can adjust plans around deals rather than rigid schedules.
